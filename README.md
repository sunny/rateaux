# Rateaux

This is a collection of useful Rake tasks for Rails.

## Install

Add this line to your Gemfile to install it with Bundler:

```ruby
# Rake tasks for Rails
gem "rateaux"
```

Then type `bundle install` in a terminal.

## Rake Tasks

### Truncate

Delete all data from the current database.

```sh
$ rake db:truncate
```

### Drop tables

Delete all data and tables from the current database. This is similar to `db:drop` but it does not drop the database itself.

```sh
$ rake db:drop_tables
```

### Encoding headers

Add the `# encoding: UTF-8` header to all ruby files in the project. Useful before Ruby 2.

```sh
$ rake encoding_headers
```

### Checkout

Remove migrations then checkout a git branch.

```sh
$ rake checkout new_branch_name
```

This will:

1. Roll back any migrations on your current branch which do not exist on the
   other branch
2. Discard any changes to the db/schema.rb file
3. Check out the other branch
4. Run any new migrations existing in the other branch
5. Update your test database

### Cache clear

Empty the cache store.

```sh
$ rake cache_clear
```

### Assets Copy Non Digested

Copy assets files with a digest (for example `application-d45eâ€¦565.css`) to their non-digested form (for example `application.css`).

```sh
$ rake assets:copy_non_digested
```

### View DB schema

View the database structure

```sh
$ rake db:schema:view
```
