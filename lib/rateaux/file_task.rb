module Rateaux
  # File Task
  #
  # Adds a task and a file task. The file depends on the task that it creates.
  #
  # For example:
  #
  #     require "rateaux/file_task"
  #     include Rateaux::FileTask
  #
  #     file_task "foo.txt", create: :environment do
  #       touch "foo.txt"
  #     end
  #
  # You can then:
  #
  #     $ rake foo.txt  # Will create the file only if it does not exist
  #     $ rake create   # Will create the file all the time
  #
  # Your tasks can now depend on the file beeing present or create them :
  #
  #     task send: "foo.txt"
  #
  # With file_task you don't have to add this block to the file task:
  #
  #     file "foo.txt" do
  #       Rake::Task["create"]
  #     end
  #
  module FileTask
    def file_task(path, definition, &block)
      t = task(definition, &block)

      file(path) do
        Rake::Task[t.name].invoke
      end
    end
  end
end
